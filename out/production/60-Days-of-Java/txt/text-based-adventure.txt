Let's Practice: Text based Adventure
Interactive Exercise: Ultimate Adventure Game

Objective In this exercise, you will create an Ultimate Adventure Game program in Java.

This exciting application will:

‚úÖ Take user input to guide through an adventure scenario.
‚úÖ Use nested switch-case statements to handle user decisions.
‚úÖ Present different scenarios based on user input.
‚úÖ Strengthen your skills in console input handling, conditional logic, and string manipulation.



Problem Statement Create an adventure game in Java using only switch-case statements.

The game will:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Present a welcome message and clearly state the player's objective.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ask the player to make choices at each scenario.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate through different scenarios based on choices.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Clearly handle invalid choices by displaying appropriate messages.

5Ô∏è‚É£ End the game when the player finds the treasure or encounters a trap.



Starter Code: Complete the Missing Parts!

import java.util.Scanner;

public class AdventureGame {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Declare and initialize Scanner object
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Display a welcome message and game objective
        //MISSING

        // Step 3: Present the first choice to the player
        //MISSING

        // Step 4: Take the user's first choice input
        String choice1 = //MISSING

        // Step 5: First level of decision-making using switch-case
        //MISSING

        // Step 6: Clearly handle invalid choices
        //MISSING

        // Step 7: Close the Scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}


Example Expected Output Here are some example interactions:

Winning Scenario:

Welcome to the Ultimate Adventure Game!

Do you want to enter the cave or walk past it?
Type 'enter' or 'walk': enter
Inside the cave, you find a sleeping dragon!
Do you want to fight the dragon or sneak past it?
Type 'fight' or 'sneak': sneak
You sneak past the dragon and find the treasure behind it. You win!


Invalid Scenario:

Welcome to the Ultimate Adventure Game!
Your goal is to find the hidden treasure. Choose wisely!
You are at a crossroad. Do you want to go left or right?
Type 'left' or 'right': forward
Invalid choice. You got lost in the wilderness. Game over.
