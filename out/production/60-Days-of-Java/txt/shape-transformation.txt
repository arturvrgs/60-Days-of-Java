Problem Statement
Imagine you have a shape-shifting variable named shapeValue.
This variable can transform into different forms based on your command.
Implement a Java program that allows you to:

✅ Define an initial shapeValue as a double.
✅ Transform shapeValue into different types (int, long, and float).
✅ Display the transformed values dynamically.
✅ Understand how type casting affects numeric precision.

Expected Output
When you run the program, you should see the following output:

Current Shape (double): 42.75
Transforming shapes...
Transformed into int: 42
Transformed into long: 42
Transformed into float: 42.75
