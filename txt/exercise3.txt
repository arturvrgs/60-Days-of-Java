ADVANCED EXERCISE: Handling User Input and Simple Calculations

WARNING! ONLY FOR ADVANCED PROGRAMMERS.
The Exercises marked as “ADVANCED” are meant to be challenging exercises for those that want to really put their knowledge to the test. They are exceptionally hard to complete continuously, so if you find yourself stuck or confused, do not worry! You have 2 options here:

    Either FAIL 3 times for the Solution Explanation to unlock, where you will get our solution to the exercise which you can copy/paste to complete the exercise.

    Or leave the exercise incomplete and try again later in the course when you feel more advanced.

Good luck with the exercise!

Handling User Input and Simple Calculations

Please, avoid changing the given source code for the exercise! Only add code, don’t modify unless it is instructed to do so!

Create a Java program that:

    Takes user input for the cost price and selling price of an item.

    Calculates and displays the profit or loss based on the difference between selling price and cost price.

    Demonstrates the use of unary operators (increment and decrement).

    Demonstrates the use of compound operators to update total revenue.

    Uses the modulo operator to calculate the remainder of a division.

The program should:

    Take input from the user using the Scanner class for both cost price and selling price.

    Use relational operators to determine and display whether the result is a profit, loss, or no profit/loss.

    Demonstrate the use of increment and decrement operators on a variable.

    Show how compound operators work by updating the total revenue after selling a given number of units.

    Use the modulo operator to find the remainder of units sold divided by a specific number.

Alert!

Make sure your program produces exact outputs for the given inputs to pass the tests.

EXTRA INFO! What does the Test Code Expect?

The test code verifies that your program correctly handles user input, calculates profit or loss, and uses various operators. Here are the details:

Test Case: Input:

    Cost Price: 100
    Selling Price: 150

Expected Output:

    Enter the cost price of the item:
    Enter the selling price of the item:
    Profit: 50.0

    Demonstrating Unary Operators:
    Initial units sold: 10
    Units sold after increment: 11
    Units sold after decrement: 10

    Demonstrating Compound Operators:
    Total revenue after selling 10 units: $1500.0

    Demonstrating Modulo Operator:
    Remainder when units sold is divided by 3: 1

Make sure your program produces this exact output to pass the tests.

Good luck
