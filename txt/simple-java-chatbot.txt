Interactive Exercise: Simple Java Chatbot
Objective
In this exercise, you will build a Simple Chatbot in Java that interacts with users by recognizing basic greetings, well-being inquiries, weather-related questions, and farewells. If the chatbot does not recognize the input, it will respond with a default message.

By completing this exercise, you will practice:

‚úÖ Reading user input using Scanner

‚úÖ Using conditional statements (if-else) to process input

‚úÖ Applying string operations to handle user queries effectively

‚úÖ Developing a simple interactive program

This chatbot will introduce you to basic decision-making logic in Java!



Problem Statement
Create a Java chatbot program that: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompts the user for input 2Ô∏è‚É£ Recognizes the following inputs and responds accordingly:

Greetings (hello, hi ‚Üí "Hello! How can I help you today?")

Well-being inquiries (how are you, how‚Äôs it going ‚Üí "I'm just a bot, but I'm here to help you!")

Weather questions (what‚Äôs the weather like, weather ‚Üí "I don‚Äôt have real-time weather data, but it's always sunny in the digital world!")

Farewells (bye, goodbye ‚Üí "Goodbye! Have a great day!") 3Ô∏è‚É£ Responds with a default message if the input is unrecognized.



Starter Code: Complete the Missing Parts!
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleChatbot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a Scanner object to read input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Prompt the user for input
        System.out.println("Please enter something: ");
        String userInput = scanner.nextLine(); // Read user input

        // Step 3: Process user input using conditional statements
        if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("hello") || userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("hi")) {
            System.out.println("Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?");
        } else if (// COMPLETE THIS PART) {
            System.out.println("Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm here to help you!");
        } else if (// COMPLETE THIS PART) {
            System.out.println("Chatbot: I don‚Äôt have real-time weather data, but it's always sunny in the digital world!");
        } else if (// COMPLETE THIS PART) {
            System.out.println("Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Chatbot: I'm sorry, I don't understand that.");
        }

        // Step 4: Close Scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}


Expected Output
Here are some sample interactions with the chatbot:

Please enter something:
hello
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?
Please enter something:
what's the weather like
Chatbot: I don‚Äôt have real-time weather data, but it's always sunny in the digital world!
Please enter something:
bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
Please enter something:
Tell me a joke
Chatbot: I'm sorry, I don't understand that.
