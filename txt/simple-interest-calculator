Let's Practice: Simple Interest Calculator
Interactive Exercise: Simple Interest Calculator
Objective
In this exercise, you will build a Simple Interest Calculator in Java. You will practice:

✅ Reading user input using Scanner

✅ Performing arithmetic operations

✅ Applying the formula for simple interest

✅ Displaying formatted output

By the end of this exercise, you will have a fully functional program that calculates simple interest based on user input.



Problem Statement
Write a Java program that:

Prompts the user to enter the principal amount, annual interest rate (percentage), and time period (years).

Calculates the simple interest using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:

SI = Simple Interest

P = Principal Amount

R = Annual Interest Rate (in percentage)

T = Time Period (in years)

Displays the calculated simple interest.



Exercise Instructions
1️⃣ Declare variables for principal amount, interest rate, and time period using double.

2️⃣ Use Scanner to read input from the user.

3️⃣ Perform the simple interest calculation using the formula.

4️⃣ Display the result in a user-friendly format.

5️⃣ Close the Scanner object after input handling.



📝 Starter Code: Try It Yourself!
Use the following template and complete the missing parts:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleInterestCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a Scanner object
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Prompt user for inputs
        System.out.print("Enter principal amount: ");
        double principal = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter annual interest rate (in percentage): ");
        double rate = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter time period (in years): ");
        double time = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Step 3: Calculate simple interest
        double interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;

        // Step 4: Display the result
        System.out.println("Simple Interest: $" + interest);

        // Step 5: Close the Scanner object
        scanner.close();
    }
}


Expected Output
After running the program, the user interaction should look like this:

Enter principal amount: 1000
Enter annual interest rate (in percentage): 5
Enter time period (in years): 3
Simple Interest: $150.0


🚀 Bonus Challenges
Want to enhance your program? Try these additional challenges:

🔹 Allow the user to enter more than one calculation in a loop until they choose to exit. 🔹 Format the output to display only two decimal places using System.out.printf(). 🔹 Add validation: Ensure the user does not enter negative values for principal, interest rate, or time.
