Let's Practice: Galaxy Weather Advisor
Interactive Exercise: Galaxy Weather Advisor
Objective
In this exercise, you will create a Galaxy Weather Advisor program in Java. This futuristic application will:

‚úÖ Take user input for a planet name. ‚úÖ Accept temperature input in Celsius for that planet. ‚úÖ Provide clothing and precautionary advice based on the planet and temperature. ‚úÖ Utilize conditional statements (if-else) and string operations (toLowerCase(), trim()).

By completing this exercise, you will strengthen your skills in user input handling, conditional logic, and string manipulation.



Problem Statement
Create a Java program that: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Asks the user for the name of a planet (Earth, Mars, Venus, or Jupiter). 2Ô∏è‚É£ Asks for the current temperature in Celsius. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Provides personalized advice based on the planet and temperature range. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handles invalid planet names gracefully by prompting the user for a valid name.



Starter Code: Complete the Missing Parts!
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GalaxyWeatherAdvisor {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Declare and initialize Scanner object
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Display a welcome message
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Galactic Weather Advisor!");
        System.out.println("Please enter the planet you are on (Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter):");

        // Step 3: Take user input for planet and convert to lowercase
        String planet = //MISSING

        // Step 4: Take current temperature as input
        System.out.println("Please enter the current temperature in Celsius:");
        double temperature = //MISSING

        // Step 5: Declare a variable to store response
        String advice = "";

        // Step 6: Compute response based on planet and temperature
        //MISSING

        // Step 7: Display response
        System.out.println(advice);

        // Step 8: Close Scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}


Expected Output
Here are some example interactions:

Earth:

Please enter the planet you are on: Earth
Please enter the current temperature in Celsius: 12
It's quite chilly on Earth. Wear a jacket.
Mars:

Please enter the planet you are on: Mars
Please enter the current temperature in Celsius: -80
It's extremely cold on Mars! Wear a space suit with thermal insulation.
Venus:

Please enter the planet you are on: Venus
Please enter the current temperature in Celsius: 450
It's scorching hot on Venus. Avoid going outside!
Unknown Planet:

Please enter the planet you are on: Pluto
Unknown planet! Please enter a valid planet name.
