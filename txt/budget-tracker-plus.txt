Let's Practice: Budget Tracker Plus
Interactive Exercise: Budget Tracker Plus
Objective
In this exercise, you will create a Budget Tracker Plus program in Java. The program will:

‚úÖ Take user input for monthly income and various expenses. ‚úÖ Perform arithmetic operations to calculate total expenses, remaining budget, and percentage of income spent per category. ‚úÖ Use string formatting to display a structured budget summary. ‚úÖ Showcase variables, data types, operators, user input handling, and formatting.

This is a practical, real-world application that will enhance your Java programming skills and financial awareness!



Problem Statement
Create a Java program that:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompts the user to enter their monthly income.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Asks for expense details in four categories:

Rent

Groceries

Transportation

Entertainment

3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculates the following:

Total expenses

Remaining budget

Percentage of income spent on each category

4Ô∏è‚É£ Displays a structured budget summary.





Starter Code: Complete the Missing Parts!
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BudgetTrackerPlus {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Declare and initialize Scanner
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Prompt user for monthly income
        System.out.print("Enter your monthly income: $");
        double income = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Step 3: Prompt user for various expenses
        System.out.print("Enter your monthly rent: $");
        double rent = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter your monthly groceries expense: $");
        double groceries = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter your monthly transportation expense: $");
        double transportation = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter your monthly entertainment expense: $");
        double entertainment = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Step 4: Calculate total expenses
        double totalExpenses = // COMPLETE THIS PART

        // Step 5: Calculate remaining budget
        double remainingBudget = // COMPLETE THIS PART

        // Step 6: Calculate percentage spent per category
        double rentPercentage = // COMPLETE THIS PART
        double groceriesPercentage = // COMPLETE THIS PART
        double transportationPercentage = // COMPLETE THIS PART
        double entertainmentPercentage = // COMPLETE THIS PART

        // Step 7: Display formatted budget summary
        System.out.println("\n********** Budget Summary **********");
        System.out.printf("Monthly Income: $%.2f\n", income);
        System.out.printf("Total Expenses: $%.2f\n", totalExpenses);
        System.out.printf("Remaining Budget: $%.2f\n", remainingBudget);
        System.out.println("Expenses Breakdown:");
        System.out.printf("  Rent: $%.2f (%.2f%% of income)\n", rent, rentPercentage);
        System.out.printf("  Groceries: $%.2f (%.2f%% of income)\n", groceries, groceriesPercentage);
        System.out.printf("  Transportation: $%.2f (%.2f%% of income)\n", transportation, transportationPercentage);
        System.out.printf("  Entertainment: $%.2f (%.2f%% of income)\n", entertainment, entertainmentPercentage);
        System.out.println("************************************");

        // Step 8: Close Scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}


Expected Output
Enter your monthly income: $5000
Enter your monthly rent: $1500
Enter your monthly groceries expense: $600
Enter your monthly transportation expense: $300
Enter your monthly entertainment expense: $400

********** Budget Summary **********
Monthly Income: $5000.00
Total Expenses: $2800.00
Remaining Budget: $2200.00
Expenses Breakdown:
  Rent: $1500.00 (30.00% of income)
  Groceries: $600.00 (12.00% of income)
  Transportation: $300.00 (6.00% of income)
  Entertainment: $400.00 (8.00% of income)
